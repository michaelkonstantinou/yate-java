The following is a test class written in %%TEST_FRAMEWORK%% to test a certain class.

%%CLASS_CONTENT%%

I want to make a modification to test %%TEST_METHOD%%. I want to change line %%LINE_NUMBER%% (%%LINE_CODE%%) so it asserts that an exception %%EXCEPTION_TYPE%% is thrown.

Please make the change and return only the new line %%LINE_NUMBER%% code
